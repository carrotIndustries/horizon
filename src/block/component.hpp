	 * by its UUID, not by its reference designator. Ensuring unique refdes
	 * is up to other parts of the application.
	 *
	 * Usually, a Component will be assigned a Part to map it to a real-world
	 * thing one can order and put on a PCB. The Part must have the same Entity
	 * as the Component. The assignment can be changed at any time. This simplifies
	 * exchanging parts for logically identical parts of the same kind.
	 * When a part Pis assigned, the value of the Component gets overriden by the Part.
